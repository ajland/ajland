<h2>üïµÔ∏è Kaggle Notebooks:</h2>

- <b>[Vesuvius Challenge - Ink Detection EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ajland/eda-a-slice-by-slice-analysis)</b>
  - Context: This competition entailed developing an algorithm to detect ink from X-Ray CT scans of scrolls that were carbonized by a fire and had known characters and character locations. The EDA explores the 65 X-Ray CT slices by plotting layer-by-layer voxel intensity histograms as well as summary statistics at each layer.
