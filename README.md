Hi, I'm Austin! </h1>

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:</h2>

- <b>[Vesuvius Challenge - Ink Detection EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ajland/eda-a-slice-by-slice-analysis)</b>
  - Context: This competition entailed developing an algorithm to detect ink from X-Ray CT scans of scrolls that were carbonized by a fire and had known characters and character locations. The EDA explores the 65 X-Ray CT slices by plotting layer-by-layer voxel intensity histograms as well as summary statistics at each layer; potential normalization and cross-validation strategies are recommended as a result. The notebook was cited by several top-10 performing teams and by an academic pre-print.
- <b>[Vesuvius Challenge - Tensorflow implementation of tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ajland/tensorflow-implementation-of-tutorial)</b>
  - The goal of this project was to re-implement the tutorial given in PyTorch with TensorFlow.
- <b>6.419x Data Analysis Written Reports</b>
  - Available upon request - made private to comply with academic integrity standards. The repo consists of 5 written reports over the 5 course Modules, most of which heavily utilized Python for the analysis. The Modules are,
    - Module 1: Review: Statistics, Correlation, Regression, Gradient Descent
    - Module 2: Genomics and High-Dimensional Data
    - Module 3: Network Analysis
    - Module 4: Time Series
    - Module 5: Environmental Data and Gaussian Processes
- <b>[Probability Maximization and Financial Investment Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UvaRfXLXauDnjb3lnqos07DutVo9rI2X#scrollTo=_LKyKw83FOpA)</b>
  - This project was carried out in the context of an MMORPG wherein I gave the community an analysis of the money/time investment likely required to obtain a particular rare item. In the context of the game, players are required to trade items to an npc for a chance of obtaining the desired quest items. One trade yields an item with probability 0.5% and the other yields its item with probability 0.4%. I assume that each trial is iid bernoulli and I progress to using the CDFs of the geometric distributions to perform the analysis.

- <b>[Monte Carlo Simulation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLtN9e9t7z3k-ZuJJLcUr7lqT1RVcO8V?authuser=1#scrollTo=pXDS5Xa4MuHk)</b>
  - Simulated the outcome and estimated the distribution of a random variable, $W = \lfloor \frac{Y_1 + Y_2}{2}M \rfloor$, where $Y_1$, $Y_2 \stackrel{iid}{\sim} U\set{45, 150}$ and $M \sim U[4.65, 5.15]$. The PMF of $\frac{Y_1 + Y_2}{2}$ is computed analytically prior to simulation to reduce the uncertainty in the estimated distribution.
